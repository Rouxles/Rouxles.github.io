                <ul>
                    <li>I was selected by the school principal to be KGV's head boy for 2020. As the head boy, I am responsible for leading the rest of the prefect team, making sure that all groups are running in sync and that there is a level of communication between staff and students.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I was invited to join the school chamber choir in 2018 by then choir director Leif Tse, and have since been singing with a group of people with strong passion for singing. The chamber choir has performed in nearly all of the school-based concerts that have been going on.</li>
                            <li>I have sang solos for 2 songs during my time in the chamber choir - Glory, and You Don't Know Me. Links for these performances can be found <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/W7i8Aq1kv7aYHPJX7" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

                        <li>Inter-house Music</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Since I joined KGV, I have always participated in Inter-House music (IHM), which is a competition where each house performs two set ensemble pieces and several solo pieces, then gets judged by a guest to decide who the winner will be.</li>
                            <li>In 2017, I applied to be a music captain, and since then, I have been a music captain, arranging the ensemble pieces as well as managing solo performances. This experience taught me a lot about how to be organized and teach people how to sing. In 2019, our house (Crozier) won the entire tournament for the first time in five years, something I will cherish for a long time.</li>

                                <li>After being part of Beacon Hill School during the course of primary school, I was invited by the long-tenured music teacher to join the community choir and sing. An extract of one of my performances can be found at the 33:00 mark of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9sdRJT4SLXVToLsg9" target="_blank">this video</a>.</li>
